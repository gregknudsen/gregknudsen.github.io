> I'm currently a software developer for Duquesene Light Company in Pittsburgh, PA<br><br>
I am a former professional [musician](http://www.sarasotaorchestra.org/our-musicians/trumpet/greg-knudsen?referer=trombinoscope){:target="_blank"}, [developer](http://www.github.com/gregknudsen){:target="_blank"}, and artist living in Indiana, PA. The art of creating has been my life for over twenty years. I will continue to create, but in a different way.<br><br>
I'm a [family man](http://imgur.com/V0moQQZ){:target="_blank"}, <span id="former">former</span> scratch golfer, lover of all (well, most) things [Apple](http://www.apple.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm a new [Walking Dead](http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead) fanatic.<br><br>
I attended [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/locations/new-york/){:target="_blank"}. This was truly an amazing experience. As a profesional trumpet player, teaching young trumpet players has always been one of my favorite things to do. Eventually, I would love to be in a position to teach people to code, as I know what a struggle it can be. To help people learn would bring be great joy (as it has for years with the trumpet!).<br><br>
When I code (and I know it's going to be a long session), I like to put on the headphones and listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N8sUccRiTA).<br><br>
