>This is a [mobile first](http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/){:target="_blank"} designed website for a bar located in Indiana, PA. I used Gatsby, HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap for layout.

>The site has been recently updated to use GatsbyJS - a static site generator that runs on React and uses GraphQL. You can find it in the Github [repo](https://github.com/gregkndusen/gatsby-brunzies){:target="_blank"}. Implementing Gatsby not only makes the site run __a lot__ faster, it was also great to be creating a web page using React again. I'm also very much interested in learning a lot more about GraphQL in the hopes that I can start to incrementally start to use in my current position at Duquesne Light.

>### [Be A Loser](http://www.bealoser.today){:target="_blank"}{:class="custom-link"}
>This website was created to serve two main purposes:

1. Direct visitors to the YouTube channel dedicated to informing viewers about the benefits of Intermittent Fasting.

2. Provide & suggest more resources to aid in one's research.

>Mobile first, and built using HTML5, CSS3, & PHP. Having never written a line of PHP prior to this project, it was a fun challenge to incorporate it into this project. I decided to use PHP because of the low cost convenience of separating out much of the code into `includes`.
